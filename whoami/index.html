        <p>
            I make mistakes.<br>
            Usually every day.
        </p>

        <p>
            But as unpleasant as they are, I do not deny them, they are part of my life and my development. On the other hand, I have a responsibility to my work, my team and my company.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think this is one of the most important elements for an open, diverse and thriving professional community: All our mistakes are a resource, if we can use them.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love the freedom and the creative opportunities the current era brought us. However, despite all the thrilling times, I will continue to focus on mistakes: Not to eliminating, but to living with them. I believe this way the most elementary – but often also hidden – forces will be understandable, not only the direct causes.
