        <p>
          I'm Andrew, a primary school teacher<sup>1</sup> with a never-ending
          passion for learning & teaching, tinkering & developing.
        </p>

        <p>
          1: Well, I started as a Junior Java Developer at <a href="https://nixstech.com/"
          target="_blank" title="Link to NIX Tech" class="inline">NIX Tech</a> at December,
          so my IT journey is taking a new level. :-) By the way, I'm still
          learning (Java SE 17, Spring Boot, Hibernate, JUnit) and improving
          my educational floor robot (<a href="https://zza.hu/uBot" target="_blank"
          title="Link to the project page of the μBot" class="inline">μBot</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
          This career change might be a bit radical… But the best step, I'm sure.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love the freedom and the creative opportunities the current era brought us.
          My goal is to be a professional developer, to help and teach people
          (backed by my experiences, skills, and creations). :-)
