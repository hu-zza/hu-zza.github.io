Jekyll theme: [Jekyll-Uno with Projects as Timeline](https://github.com/tzuehlke/jekyll-uno-timeline) by [Thomas Zühlke](https://github.com/tzuehlke).

Main changes briefly:
- modified color scheme (sepia)
- mobile menu has been deleted
- added close button for projects tab at mobile view
- deleted foundation icons
- all icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- slightly modified responsive layout
- added modal for profile picture ([Featherlight](https://github.com/noelboss/featherlight/))
- extract some personal info into _config.yml
- simplify main.js, timeline handling is now easy
- delete some [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) methods (css, animate)
- pure CSS animations
- all libraries are self hosted (jQuery, Font Awesome, Featherlight)
- multi-project feature (now only GitHub and plain links)
- and some others too, those are Easter eggs... (I will write a better doc, I promise... >< )
