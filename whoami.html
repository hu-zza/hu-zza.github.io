        <p>I'm Andrew, a primary school teacher with a never-ending eager to learning & teaching, tinkering & developing.</p>
        <p>Nowadays I'm a beta tester at JetBrains Academy (hyperskill.org), and a lecturer at a primary school. In my spare time I'm learning (Java SE 11, Spring Boot, Hibernate) and improving my educational floor robot (Î¼Bot).</p>
        <p>I love the freedom and the creative opportunities the current era brought us. My goal is to be a professional developer, to help and teach people (backed by my experiences, skills and creations).</p>
