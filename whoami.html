        <p>
            I'm Andrew, a primary school teacher with a never-ending eager to
            learning & teaching, tinkering & developing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nowadays I'm a beta tester at JetBrains Academy (<a href="https://hyperskill.org" target="_blank"
            title="Link to JetBrains Academy" class="inline">hyperskill.org</a>), and a lecturer at a
            primary school. In my spare time I'm learning (Java SE 11, Spring Boot, Hibernate, JUnit) and
            improving my educational floor robot (<a href="https://zza.hu/uBot" target="_blank"
            title="Link to the project page of the μBot" class="inline">μBot</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            I love the freedom and the creative opportunities the current era brought us. My goal is to be
            a professional developer, to help and teach people (backed by my experiences, skills and creations).
        </p>
